## 🧠 Mix-or-Match Memory Game

A simple JavaScript memory game built as a learning project.  
The goal is to flip cards and find matching pairs before the time runs out.

⚙️ Technologies  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- GSAP (for basic animations)

✨ Features  
- 4×4 memory card grid  
- Random card shuffle on every restart  
- Flip counter to track moves  
- Countdown timer  
- Card match and unmatch logic  
- Restart option after winning or time up  
- Simple and interactive UI  

🔁 Process  
I started by creating the basic layout using HTML and CSS.  
Then I used JavaScript to generate shuffled cards and handle card flipping.

This project helped me understand DOM manipulation and event handling by tracking flipped cards, matched pairs, number of flips, and remaining time.

I also added simple animations using GSAP to make the game feel more interactive and fun.
